# *Internet in Mexico* #

### When did Mexico connect to the internet?
Around 35 years ago, in 1988, a group of Tecnológico de Monterrey university graduates made the first connection to the Internet in Mexico and Latin America. [^1] This occurred through a MicroVAX II computer, using the address 131.178.1.1 and mnetv1.mty.itesm.mx. [^2]

### Where are the ports of connection?
There are multiple ports of connection all over Mexico, the map below was made by TELMEX, one of Mexico's main telecommunications company, which illustrates the fiber optic network backbone in the country as of 2013.
